### Clustering to find flat surfaces in a depth image.

clustering.py = Uses a crude clustering algorithm to find flat surfaces in a depth image.

planar_seg.py = Uses PCL and Autolab visualization to find flat (planar) surfaces parallel to ground in a depth image.

stable_poses.py = Uses the given object mesh to find the most probable stable poses of that object using trimesh.

surface.py = [Unfinished] Original concept for finding best placement surface.

best_location.py = [In progress] New concept for finding best placement surface.

test1.py and test2.py = Tests for clustering.py.
